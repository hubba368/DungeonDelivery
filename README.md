A lightweight roguelite deckbuilding game made in Unity. In Progress.

Current game mechanic idea for this game is the concept of combining 'Item' and 'Action' cards. Combining cards will then create your actual cards that you would use in battle.
For example, if there was a 'Throw' action card and a 'health potion' item card, it would create a 'throw potion' card that you could throw at a target.
